## General Information
This project aims to build a CNN model for accurately detecting melanoma, a deadly type of skin cancer. Melanoma can be fatal if not detected early, and manual diagnosis can be time-consuming. The model is designed to assist dermatologists by evaluating images and alerting them about the presence of melanoma, potentially reducing the manual effort needed for diagnosis.

### Business Problem
The business problem this project is trying to solve is the early detection of melanoma. By accurately identifying melanoma from images, the model can assist dermatologists in making faster and more accurate diagnoses, potentially saving lives.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, including melanoma. The images are sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) and are sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC.

## Conclusions
-The CNN model achieved a commendable accuracy on the validation set, indicating its effectiveness in detecting melanoma.
-Data augmentation was instrumental in enhancing the model's performance, mitigating overfitting, and improving its ability to generalize.
-Analysis of class distribution highlighted areas for potential improvement in the dataset
-The model successfully addressed class imbalances, resulting in a more balanced dataset and improved model performance.
-The training and validation accuracy showed consistent improvement over epochs, with the model achieving approximately 75% accuracy on the validation set.
-The gap between training and validation accuracy reduced significantly, indicating improved generalization of the model to unseen data.
